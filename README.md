# Genetic Algorithms
Particle Swarm Optimization utilized as minimizer in the Least Square fitting process

Install Root (https://root.cern/) before running the algorithm

The model to use in the fitting process has to be defined in src-->PSMin.cc as a paramteric TF# function

The histogram to fit has to be provided in src-->PSMin.cc as a TH# hystogram in a .root file
